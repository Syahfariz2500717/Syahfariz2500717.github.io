# 📊 Sleep Patterns vs. Academic Performance: A Student's Journey

## The Story Behind This Project

During my **second year Psychology Research Methods** course, I conducted an independent study exploring how lifestyle factors affect academic outcomes. As a student juggling coursework, part-time work, and extracurricular activities, I noticed my own grades fluctuated with my sleep schedule. This sparked my curiosity: *Was there a quantifiable relationship between sleep and academic performance across the student population?*

### **Research Context:**
- **Timeline:** Conducted over Fall 2023 semester
- **Sample:** 85 undergraduate students (voluntary participation)
- **Method:** Daily sleep logs + end-of-semester GPA collection
- **Ethics:** Anonymous data collection with institutional approval
- **Personal Motivation:** To make data-driven decisions about my own study habits
