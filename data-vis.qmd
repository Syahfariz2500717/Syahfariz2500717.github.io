## My Visualization Project

I created this visualization during my **Data Science** course. The task was to explore the `mtcars` datasets.

### Steps I followed:

1. Loaded the data in R
2. Cleaned column names
3. Created a scatter plot with `ggplot2`

### Here’s the code I used:

```{r}
#| label: fig-mpg-vs-hp
#| fig-cap: "MPG vs Horsepower in mtcars dataset"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Horsepower")
```

### Key Findings:

- **Negative correlation**: Higher horsepower generally means lower MPG
- **Outliers**: Some cars have unusual MPG for their horsepower
- > This insight helped me understand engine efficiency trade-offs

### Resources:

- [Dataset Documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html)
- [ggplot2 Cheatsheet](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
