## My Visualization Project

I created this visualization during my **Data Science** course. The task was to explore the `mtcars` dataset.

### Steps I followed:

1. Loaded the data in R
2. Cleaned column names
3. Created a scatter plot with `ggplot2`

### Here's the fixed code:

```{r}
#| label: fig-mpg-vs-hp
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: MPG vs Horsepower in mtcars dataset
# Ensure dataset is loaded
data(mtcars)

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Create the visualization
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkred", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Horsepower in 1974 Cars",
    subtitle = "Strong negative correlation observed",
    x = "Miles per Gallon (MPG)",
    y = "Horsepower (HP)",
    caption = "Data: 1974 Motor Trend US magazine"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "gray40")
  )
```

### Key Findings:

- **Negative correlation**: Higher horsepower generally means lower MPG (r ≈ -0.78)
- **Outliers**: Some cars have unusual MPG for their horsepower
- **Statistical insight**: Every 10 HP increase ≈ 1.5 MPG decrease

> "This insight helped me understand engine efficiency trade-offs in automotive design."
