## My Visualization Project

I created this visualization during my **Data Science** course. The task was to explore the `mtcars` dataset.


### Key Findings:

- **Negative correlation**: Higher horsepower generally means lower MPG (r ≈ -0.78)
- **Outliers**: Some cars have unusual MPG for their horsepower
- **Statistical insight**: Every 10 HP increase ≈ 1.5 MPG decrease

> "This insight helped me understand engine efficiency trade-offs in automotive design."
